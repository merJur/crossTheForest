Help the little rabbit to go through the forest.. The little rabbit has to jump over bonfires, dangerous bears, and has to dodge a lot of honeyballs.  

Your goal is to take the bigger number of carrots as you can and croos the forest to the end, for the bonus points!.
(Could you be able to get more points than others??!!?)


To help the little rabbit, use the 'w' key to jump, 'a' key to go left, and 'd' key to go right.
